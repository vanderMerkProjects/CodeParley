// Step 4, stage 3 of the release-signing workflow (docs/releasing.md): turn a staged release (stage-release.mjs) whose
// manifest the TD accepted into a signing package outside the repository, for the owner. Nothing is rebuilt (A-1): the
// files are copied byte for byte and checked again. Nothing is signed (A-4), and nothing here is an authority for the
// owner: SIGNING-REQUEST.md is a comparison sheet without commands. The owner runs the commands of docs/releasing.md
// from a verified clone, with the version, commit and manifest digest typed from the TD's acceptance record.
//
//   node scripts/package/prepare-signing.mjs --staged <dir> --out <dir> --version <v> --commit <sha>
//        --manifest-sha256 <accepted digest> [--gpg <gpg>] [--rehearsal]
//
// Checks, all fail-closed: the accepted manifest digest; the manifest and every BUILD-ID (version, commit, a clean build
// of a verified commit, one toolchain); every artifact's size, SHA-256 and carried BUILD-ID; nothing else in the staged
// directory; the commit signed by the owner's pinned commit key and carrying the version; unless --rehearsal, the
// commit integrated into the clone's fetched main by the GitHub merge whose second parent it is, with its tree
// (lib/release-verify.mjs integrationOf; C-1); the release key the commit pins,
// with the CURRENT approved signing subkey in it, unexpired and unrevoked (the request names that subkey).
// Repeating the command with the same inputs leaves a complete package as it is (also after the owner signed it); a
// package that differs is refused, never overwritten. An interrupted run leaves only a `<out>.partial-*` directory,
// which the next run removes. --rehearsal prepares a --test-version build, marked so throughout, for a signing
// rehearsal with a disposable key; the release key never signs one.
// Exit status: 0 prepared (or already prepared); 1 a check failed; 2 a usage or tool error.
