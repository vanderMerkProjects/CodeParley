// Phase 6 Increment 3 (contract §3.4): the remediation catalog — for each refusal an operator or the implementer is
// likely to meet, its cause and the command that fixes it, in this platform's terms. The CLI prints it under an error
// and the MCP server adds it to an error result (`error.remedy`).
//
// Wording only. A remedy names a command a person runs; it records, grants and confirms nothing, and nothing reads it to
// decide anything. It never quotes protected content or a path from the error: the error's own message carries the
