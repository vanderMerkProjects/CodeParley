# Installing CodeParley

CodeParley has two install routes:

| Route | What you install | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [Protected](#windows-11-protected-install) | The installer, the custodian service, the engine runtime and the Claude Code plugin | Everything: manual review, the protected loop, optional delegated fixes |
| [Manual review](#manual-review-any-platform) | The npm tarball | Reviews, checks, discussion and your decisions, with no custodian |

Protected mode runs on two platforms only: Windows 11 x64, and Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 with kernel 6.8.
Everywhere else, including WSL2, use manual review. Claude Code (CLI) is the only supported host for
protected mode; Claude Desktop is manual review only.

## The accounts

Protected mode separates who does the work from who approves it. These are real, separate OS
accounts.

| Role | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| **Implementer**: runs Claude Code, `init`, the checks and the self-tests | A standard user | An ordinary login, in no administrative group |
| **Operator**: confirms every protected record by typing | An administrator, in an elevated terminal | A separate login, through `/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator` |
| **Administrator**: runs the installer | Elevated PowerShell | `root` (`sudo`) |

On Windows the operator and the administrator may be the same person and account. The installer
never creates the human accounts: they must exist first.

## Get the release

Version 1.0.0 was released privately. The first public binary release is 1.0.1, on the
[releases page](https://github.com/vanderMerkProjects/CodeParley/releases); until it appears there, no public
binary is available. The file names in this guide are 1.0.1's, the version of these sources. For any release, follow
its signed manifest and use the artifact file names it lists.

A release's artifacts are:

| File | Used by |
|---|---|
| `release-manifest.json` and its detached signature | Everyone: verify these first |
| `codeparley-installer.ps1`, `custodian-windows-x64.tar.gz`, `engine-runtime-windows-x64.tar.gz`, `plugin-windows.tar.gz` | Windows protected install |
| `codeparley-installer.sh`, `custodian-linux-x64.tar.gz`, `engine-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz`, `plugin-linux.tar.gz` | Linux protected install |
| `code-parley-1.0.1.tgz` | Manual review |

Put them in one directory; this document calls it `<dir>`. The installers bundle Node.js 26 in the
engine runtime (1.0.0 and 1.0.1: Node.js 24.22.2; each release's BUILD-IDs name its version) and a
self-contained .NET runtime in the custodian: the target needs no SDK or Node.js.

## Verify a release

The owner signs `release-manifest.json` with a separate release key. The manifest lists each
artifact with its size and SHA-256. The installers check size, SHA-256 and BUILD-ID against the
manifest, but they do **not** check its signature. Verify the signature yourself, first, or those
checks prove nothing.

1. Check the signature against the release key's fingerprint, published in
   [verifying-releases.md](verifying-releases.md#the-release-key). Here the detached
   signature is `release-manifest.json.asc`; use the name the release gives it.

   ```bash
   gpg --import <release public key file>
   gpg --verify release-manifest.json.asc release-manifest.json
   ```

   Compare the `Primary key fingerprint` that `gpg` prints with the published fingerprint, character
   by character. `Good signature` alone only says that some key in your keyring signed the file.

2. Check each artifact against the manifest.

   Linux:

   ```bash
   python3 -I -c 'import json; [print(a["sha256"]+"  "+a["file"]) for a in json.load(open("release-manifest.json"))["artifacts"]]' \
     | sha256sum --strict -c -
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell, in `<dir>`):

   ```powershell
   $m = Get-Content release-manifest.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
   foreach ($a in $m.artifacts) {
     $h = (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath $a.file).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
     if ($h -ne $a.sha256) { throw "$($a.file) does not match the manifest" }
   }
   ```

   If you only downloaded one platform's files, the command stops at the first file you do not have;
   that is not a mismatch.

3. Check that `"releaseCandidate": true` is in the manifest. The installers warn when it is not.
   The flag means the manifest was built from a clean, signed commit; it does not mark a pre-release.
   The 1.0.0 manifest has it.

## Windows 11 protected install

### Windows prerequisites

- Windows 11 x64.
- An administrator account for the operator, and a separate standard user for the implementer.
- Git for Windows, installed machine-wide, 2.41 or later (2.45+ for partial clones). The engine
  runtime does not bundle it: the operator approves an installed `git.exe`.
- Codex CLI 0.160.x in an **administrator-controlled directory** outside the implementer's writable
  locations, for example under `C:\Program Files`, as the complete release layout. The implementer
  must be able to run it and only administrators to change it. The standalone Codex installer places
  it in a user profile, where the custodian cannot measure it: protected reviews refuse that. Use
  the native `codex.exe`, not a launcher or a link.
- Claude Code for the implementer, and Codex logged in for the implementer (`codex login`).
- The implementer works in a signed-in desktop session: Codex's `mxc` sandbox does not start from a
  service, PowerShell Direct or a scheduled batch logon.
- CodeParley's client talks to the custodian through Windows PowerShell 5.1 in FullLanguage mode. A
  Constrained Language, AppLocker or WDAC policy blocks it, and protected calls fail closed.

A repository may live under the implementer's profile, for example `C:\Users\you\src\app`.
`grant-repository` gives the helper read access to the repository, and gives the custodian service
read-attributes on the repository and on each folder between it and the profile, plus read-control on
the repository. Nothing on the profile folder itself changes, and `revoke-repository` removes these
entries.

### Install

In elevated PowerShell, as an administrator:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <dir>\codeparley-installer.ps1 install `
  -Release <dir> -Operator <MACHINE\admin> -Implementer <MACHINE\user>
```

This document writes that as `codeparley-installer.ps1 <verb>` from here on. The verbs are
`install`, `upgrade`, `rollback`, `uninstall`, `purge`, `grant-repository`, `revoke-repository` and
`status`.

The installer checks every artifact against the manifest, then installs:

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| The custodian service | `CodeParleyCustodian`, automatic delayed start |
| The helper service | `CodeParleyHelper`, started by the custodian |
| Binaries and engine runtime | `C:\Program Files\CodeParley\custodian\<version>`, `...\engine\<version>` |
| The command | `C:\Program Files\CodeParley\bin\code-parley.cmd`, on the machine `PATH` |
| The protected store | `C:\ProgramData\CodeParley\Custodian` |
| The group | `CodeParley Repository Readers` |

Open a **new** terminal to see `code-parley` on the `PATH`.

### Set up a repository

Do this once per repository. `code-parley init` prints these steps with your paths filled in.

**1. The implementer** registers the repository, approves the checks and runs the self-test.
Pointing `codex.executable` in `config.json` at the administrator's Codex is simplest:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodeParley\config.json`, `"codex": { "executable": "C:\\...\\codex.exe" }`.

```powershell
code-parley init --repo C:\src\app
code-parley checks list --repo C:\src\app
code-parley checks approve --repo C:\src\app --from-proposals --required-profile <profile>
code-parley codex selftest --codex <codex.exe>
```

`checks approve` needs checks to approve: either `proposed_checks` in the repository's
`.code-parley/config.json`, or a definitions file with `--file`
([README](../README.md#approving-checks)). It shows exactly what will run and asks you to type
`approve`. Restart open Claude Code sessions after `init`.

**2. An administrator** lets the helper read the repository:

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 grant-repository -Path C:\src\app
```

**3. The operator**, in an elevated terminal, runs `setup`. Git refuses a repository another account
owns, so add it to the operator's own `safe.directory` first. `--home` names the implementer's data
home, where `setup` reads the approved checks and the stored self-test.

```powershell
git config --global --add safe.directory C:/src/app
code-parley setup --repo C:\src\app --home <implementer's %LOCALAPPDATA%\CodeParley> `
  --codex <codex.exe> `
  --runtime-git-path "C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\git.exe" `
  --loops 1 --minutes 60
```

`setup` walks through the records in order. For each one the custodian renders what will be recorded
and you type `confirm` (`allow` for the loop grant). Anything else stops there and records nothing
further; running `setup` again continues. Steps already in force are skipped. Without `--no-grant`
the last step grants automated loops: `--loops` 1 to 8 (default 1), `--minutes` 1 to 180 (default
60).

The first step, approving the engine runtime, takes a while: the custodian measures every file.

**4. The implementer** installs the plugin, once per account:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory <plugin dir>
tar -xzf <dir>\plugin-windows.tar.gz -C <plugin dir>
claude plugin marketplace add <plugin dir>
claude plugin install code-parley@code-parley-local --scope user
```

Keep `<plugin dir>`. Start a new Claude Code session.

**5. Check it:**

```powershell
code-parley status --repo C:\src\app
code-parley doctor --protected --repo C:\src\app
```

`status` exits 0 and says `READY` when the repository is set up. That is a display: it grants
nothing. Go on with [docs/protected-workflow.md](protected-workflow.md).

## Ubuntu 24.04 protected install

### Linux prerequisites

The custodian checks these at every start and refuses to serve if one fails:

- Ubuntu 24.04, kernel 6.8.x, x86_64. Not WSL.
- The default kernel hardening is in place: `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope` ≥ 1, `fs.protected_symlinks`
  and `fs.protected_hardlinks` = 1, `fs.protected_regular` and `fs.protected_fifos` ≥ 1,
  `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` = 1.
- The implementer is in none of the groups `sudo`, `admin`, `wheel`, `adm`, `lxd`, `docker`,
  `libvirt`, `disk`, `kvm`, `shadow`, `systemd-journal`.
- The operator is a different account from the implementer.
- `/proc` does not hide other users' processes from the custodian.

The installer and `grant-repository` also need:

- Root, and `python3`.
- The system libraries the bundled Node.js needs. Node.js 26's official Linux build needs
  `libatomic1`, which a minimal Ubuntu 24.04 server may lack: `sudo apt install libatomic1`. The
  installer reads what the bundled Node.js needs from the verified engine archive and refuses,
  before it changes anything, while one is missing (it never installs packages itself). After
  unpacking, it checks that the bundled Node.js starts before any service is stopped.
- The tools `findmnt`, `dumpe2fs`, `setfacl`, `getfacl`, `runuser`, `systemctl`, `systemd-tmpfiles`,
  `useradd`, `groupadd`, `usermod`. Most are there by default; for the rest: `sudo apt install acl
  e2fsprogs`.
- The store and each repository on the **root filesystem**, ext4 with `metadata_csum`, 256-byte
  inodes and birth time.
- An administrator-supplied Codex CLI 0.160.x: a directory with `bin/codex` and
  `codex-resources/bwrap`. The installer copies it root-owned to `/opt/codeparley-codex/<version>`.
- `/usr/bin/git`, 2.41 or later (2.45+ for partial clones). `setup` approves it by default.
- Claude Code for the implementer.

### Install

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh install --release <dir> \
  --implementer <login> --operator <login> --codex <codex dir> --load-apparmor
```

`--load-apparmor` loads an AppArmor profile that lets Codex's copied `bwrap` use user namespaces. It
is a machine-wide change; read [what it grants](security.md#linux-sandbox-and-service-hardening)
first. Without it the profile is only staged at `/opt/codeparley/codeparley-codex-bwrap.profile`,
and the Codex self-test fails on this kernel configuration. The installer loads it only together
with `--codex`, at `install`.

The installer adds the implementer to `codeparley-impl` and `codeparley-read`, and the operator to
`codeparley-op` and `codeparley-read`. **Both must log in again** for the new groups to take effect.

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| The custodian | `/opt/codeparley/custodian/<version>`, run by systemd as the account `codeparley` |
| The sockets | `codeparley-implementer.socket`, `codeparley-operator.socket`, `codeparley-helper.socket`, enabled at boot |
| The engine runtime | `/opt/codeparley/engine/<version>`, with a `current` link |
| The implementer's command | `/usr/local/bin/code-parley` |
| The operator's command | `/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator`. Always use this absolute path |
| The protected store | `/var/lib/codeparley` |
| Trusted configuration | `/etc/codeparley` |

### Set up a repository

Do this once per repository. `code-parley init` prints these steps with your paths filled in. The
examples use `CODEX=/opt/codeparley-codex/0.160.0/bin/codex` and a repository at
`/home/impl/src/app`.

**1. The implementer** logs Codex in, registers the repository, approves the checks and runs the
self-test. The installer keeps Codex off the `PATH`, so name it, or set `codex.executable` in
`~/.config/code-parley/config.json`.

```bash
$CODEX login
code-parley init --repo /home/impl/src/app
code-parley checks list --repo /home/impl/src/app
code-parley checks approve --repo /home/impl/src/app --from-proposals --required-profile <profile>
code-parley codex selftest --codex $CODEX
```

Restart open Claude Code sessions after `init`. The operator cannot read your data home or the
repository, so you write what it will confirm into proposal files. Use a new file name each time, in
a directory the operator can read:

```bash
install -d -m 0755 /tmp/cp-proposals
code-parley config propose --repo /home/impl/src/app --out /tmp/cp-proposals/repo.json --codex $CODEX
code-parley config propose-selftest --repo /home/impl/src/app --out /tmp/cp-proposals/s1.json --codex $CODEX
```

The files hold check definitions and digests, no secrets, and every local user can read them while
they exist. The custodian validates them and measures Codex itself, so a proposal is only a claim
until the operator confirms the rendering.

**2. An administrator** grants read access and restarts the custodian, which admits the repository's
filesystem:

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh grant-repository --path /home/impl/src/app
sudo systemctl restart codeparley-custodian.service
```

`--path` must be a plain absolute path with no link in it. The grant gives `codeparley-readers` read
access on the tree, the custodian read access on the top directory, and a traverse entry on each
ancestor that others cannot already search (a home directory with mode `0750`, say). Each is
recorded.

**3. The operator**, logged in as the operator account:

```bash
/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator setup --repo /home/impl/src/app \
  --proposal-file /tmp/cp-proposals/repo.json \
  --proposal-file /tmp/cp-proposals/s1.json \
  --loops 1 --minutes 60
```

`setup` routes each proposal by what it proposes. It approves the engine runtime (the versioned
directory `current` names, with `/usr/bin/git`), sets the repository's configuration, confirms the
S1 self-test and grants the loops. For each one the custodian renders what will be recorded and you
type `confirm` (`allow` for the loop grant). Anything else stops there and records nothing further.
It needs an interactive terminal; no flag skips the confirmations.

**4. The implementer** installs the plugin, once per account:

```bash
mkdir -p <plugin dir>
tar -xzf <dir>/plugin-linux.tar.gz -C <plugin dir>
claude plugin marketplace add <plugin dir>
claude plugin install code-parley@code-parley-local --scope user
```

Keep `<plugin dir>`. Start a new Claude Code session.

**5. Check it:**

```bash
code-parley status --repo /home/impl/src/app
code-parley doctor --protected --repo /home/impl/src/app
```

`status` exits 0 and says `READY` when the repository is set up. That is a display: it grants
nothing. Go on with [docs/protected-workflow.md](protected-workflow.md).

## Turning on delegated fixes

Delegated fixes are off by default, and normal review and Claude-led remediation work with them off.
To opt in, for one repository:

Windows, as the implementer, then the operator in an elevated terminal:

```powershell
code-parley init --repo C:\src\app --max-fixes 3
code-parley codex fix-selftest --codex <codex.exe>
```

```powershell
code-parley setup --fix --repo C:\src\app --home <implementer's %LOCALAPPDATA%\CodeParley> --no-grant
```

Linux, as the implementer, then the operator:

```bash
code-parley init --repo /home/impl/src/app --max-fixes 3
code-parley codex fix-selftest --codex $CODEX
code-parley config propose-selftest --fix --repo /home/impl/src/app --out /tmp/cp-proposals/fix.json --codex $CODEX
```

```bash
/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator setup --fix --repo /home/impl/src/app \
  --proposal-file /tmp/cp-proposals/fix.json --no-grant
```

`--max-fixes` takes 1 to 10; 0 turns delegated fixes off again. It is written to
`budgets.max_fixes_per_run` in the implementer's `config.json`. Restart open sessions; a new run
picks it up. The operator's confirmation before any patch is applied is separate and always needed:
[docs/protected-workflow.md](protected-workflow.md#delegated-fixes).

## Upgrade

Verify the new release first. An upgrade stops the services, backs the store up, migrates it and
keeps the previous version for a one-step rollback. The two most recent backups are kept.

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 upgrade -Release <new dir>
```

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh upgrade --release <new dir>
```

Protected reviews are refused until the operator approves the new engine runtime. `status` reports
the engine runtime `changed`:

Windows, in an elevated terminal as the operator:

```powershell
code-parley status --repo C:\src\app
code-parley setup --resume --repo C:\src\app --runtime-git-path "C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\git.exe"
```

Linux, as the operator:

```bash
/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator setup --resume --repo /home/impl/src/app
```

**On Windows, also reinstall the plugin after each upgrade**, as the implementer: its hooks and
server name the versioned engine path. On Linux the plugin follows the `current` link and needs
nothing.

```powershell
claude plugin uninstall code-parley@code-parley-local --scope user
claude plugin marketplace remove code-parley-local
New-Item -ItemType Directory <new plugin dir>
tar -xzf <new dir>\plugin-windows.tar.gz -C <new plugin dir>
claude plugin marketplace add <new plugin dir>
claude plugin install code-parley@code-parley-local --scope user
```

If an upgrade is interrupted, the custodian refuses to serve until it is finished. Complete it, or
roll back:

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 upgrade -Resume
```

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh upgrade --resume
```

### A Codex update

Protected reviews run only the exact Codex file the operator approved, so an update of that file
makes `status` report the repository record `changed` and refuses protected reviews until it is
approved. S1 and FIX confirmations are bound to the Codex binary too, so run the self-tests again
first.

CodeParley supports Codex 0.160.x; other versions are refused.

- **Windows:** put the new version in an administrator-controlled directory. The implementer runs
  `code-parley codex selftest --codex <new codex.exe>`. The operator runs `code-parley setup
  --resume --repo <path> --home <implementer's data home> --codex <new codex.exe>`.
- **Linux:** the installer copies Codex at `install` only; `upgrade` does not take a new one. After
  a new copy is in place, the implementer runs `code-parley codex selftest --codex <new codex>`,
  then `code-parley config propose` and `code-parley config propose-selftest` with `--codex <new
  codex>`. The operator runs `/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator setup --resume --repo <path>
  --proposal-file <file>` with both files.

## Rollback

Rollback returns to the kept previous build, restoring the store from the backup taken for it.

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 rollback
```

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh rollback
```

It is one step: afterwards no previous build is kept, and a second rollback is refused. It is also
refused if the backup is missing, does not match its recorded SHA-256, or holds a store format the
previous build does not serve; nothing is changed then.

A restored store must not bring back authority. So at its next start the custodian:

- ends every open protected run, with the reason `restored`;
- voids every unconsumed delegated-fix confirmation and every prepared request;
- suspends every loop grant;
- lapses every approval: configuration, engine runtime, S1 and FIX confirmations.

Nothing done after the backup is re-authorized. The operator re-confirms what is still wanted, with
`setup --resume` as after an upgrade. Start new runs. On Windows, reinstall the plugin from the
**previous** release's `plugin-windows` archive.

## Uninstall and purge

| | `uninstall` | `purge` |
|---|---|---|
| Services or units, binaries, engine runtime, the commands | Removed | Removed |
| Windows event-log source | Removed | Removed |
| Linux Codex copy and AppArmor profile | Removed | Removed |
| The protected store | **Kept** | Removed |
| Backups | **Kept** | Removed |
| Windows group `CodeParley Repository Readers` | **Kept** | Removed |
| Linux service accounts and groups, `/etc/codeparley` | **Kept** | Removed |
| Linux membership of your two accounts in the groups | **Kept** | Removed |
| Per-repository grants the installer recorded | **Kept**, listed | Removed |
| The install record | Updated | Removed |

**Neither touches** the Claude Code plugin, the implementer's data home, or `config.json`. Remove
the plugin yourself ([plugin/README.md](../plugin/README.md)). The Windows Codex installation and
your Git are yours and stay.

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 uninstall
codeparley-installer.ps1 purge -ConfirmStore "C:\ProgramData\CodeParley\Custodian"
```

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh uninstall
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh purge --confirm-store /var/lib/codeparley
```

`purge` is destructive and asks for the exact store path as confirmation. It reports anything it
could not remove. To remove one repository's grant without uninstalling:

```powershell
codeparley-installer.ps1 revoke-repository -Path C:\src\app
```

```bash
sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh revoke-repository --path /home/impl/src/app
```

`install` after `uninstall` works on both platforms and keeps the store. Give the accounts again,
and on Linux `--codex` and `--load-apparmor`: the Codex copy and the profile were removed, so
`status` then shows what must be approved again.

`codeparley-installer.ps1 status` and `sudo bash codeparley-installer.sh status` show the services,
the installed and previous version, the store, the backups and the repository grants.

## After a reboot

By design a restart of the OS lapses the operator's records and suspends loop grants: an approval
made before a boot does not silently carry over. The custodian comes back by itself: on Windows the
service has a delayed automatic start, about two minutes after boot on the test VM; on Linux the
sockets are enabled at boot.

First check what lapsed:

```bash
code-parley status --repo <path>
```

**Windows.** The operator, in an elevated terminal:

```powershell
code-parley setup --resume --repo C:\src\app --loops 1 --minutes 60
```

One re-confirmation covers the repository's configuration and the lapsed global records, including
the S1 confirmation. A suspended grant never comes back: a new grant is a separate step. Add `--fix`
if you use delegated fixes. If `status` names `--home` for a record, add it.

**Linux.** An S1 confirmation is bound to its boot and is never re-confirmed: it needs a new
self-test. A reboot also empties `/tmp`.

```bash
# the implementer
code-parley codex selftest --codex $CODEX
install -d -m 0755 /tmp/cp-proposals
code-parley config propose-selftest --repo /home/impl/src/app --out /tmp/cp-proposals/s1-boot2.json --codex $CODEX
```

```bash
# the operator
/usr/local/sbin/code-parley-operator setup --resume --repo /home/impl/src/app \
  --proposal-file /tmp/cp-proposals/s1-boot2.json --loops 1 --minutes 60
```

For delegated fixes, also run `codex fix-selftest` and `config propose-selftest --fix`, and pass
that file with `--fix`.

A loop that was running is paused. `code-parley loop resume <run>` offers the re-confirmation first,
then shows what it would accept. User decisions that the recovery lapsed are listed there, and must
be recorded again to keep them.

The first protected request after a boot makes the custodian measure the engine runtime, and a call
queued behind that can be refused `CUSTODIAN_BUSY`. See
[docs/troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#custodian_busy).

## Self-test confirmations in `status`

A confirmation counts only for the stored self-test that a protected review (S1) or a delegated fix
(FIX) would actually use: the approved Codex installation, on the backend the review or the fix
selects. An older confirmation does not make a newer self-test current.

- **`UNCONFIRMED`**: the custodian holds a confirmation, but not of the stored self-test. The
  self-test was run again, the record is missing, or Codex, the backend or the profile changed.
  Protected reviews (or delegated fixes) are refused until the operator confirms the stored one.
  The detail says which case it is. `setup --resume` offers the confirmation; for a missing or
  failed record the implementer runs `code-parley codex selftest` (or `fix-selftest`) first.
- **`UNVERIFIED`**: this account cannot read the implementer's stored self-tests, so nothing is
  claimed either way. The repository then reads `UNKNOWN`. On Linux the operator account never can,
  by design: the implementer's own `code-parley status --repo <path>` makes the comparison. On
  Windows, the operator adds `--home <the implementer's data home>`.
- **`REVOKED`**: the operator revoked that confirmation. `setup --resume` does not restore it;
  `setup` without `--resume` asks for a new confirmation.

When the operator's own steps are complete but the implementer's store could not be read, `setup`
says so and exits with code 3, naming the command that verifies it. It does not report the
repository as ready.

If a re-confirmation after a restart is refused `CONFIG_MISMATCH` (for example because Codex was
reinstalled with the same bytes), `setup` does not repeat it. In the same run it offers to set the
configuration again. The custodian renders that record and it needs its own typed confirmation. On
Linux it needs the implementer's `config propose` file.

`setup` refuses `--codex` or `--backend` values that protected execution would not use: another
installation than the approved one, or a backend the review or the fix does not select. Nothing is
recorded in that case.

## Manual review (any platform)

You need Node.js `^26.13` (1.0.0 and 1.0.1: `^22.12 || ^24`), git 2.41 or later, and Codex CLI 0.160.x, logged in. The
[README](../README.md#requirements-for-manual-review) has the details per platform. Installing the
npm tarball gives you no custodian: protected loops and delegated fixes are refused.

```bash
npm install -g code-parley-1.0.1.tgz
code-parley init --repo <path>

`init` prints the steps of a protected install too; for manual review, you need only the checks and
the self-test from that list.

Register the server with your host. Use `node` plus the script path, not a `.cmd` shim; `npm root
-g` prints the folder that holds `code-parley`.

**Claude Code:**

```powershell
claude mcp add --scope user code-parley -- "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "<npm root -g>\code-parley\dist\server\main.js"
```

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user code-parley -- "$(command -v node)" "$(npm root -g)/code-parley/dist/server/main.js"
```

Add `--diagnostics` at the end to register `diag_echo` (setup diagnostics). Allow the tools in your
Claude Code permissions (`mcp__code-parley__…`) or approve them when asked.

**Claude Desktop, Chat tab.** Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (the Microsoft
Store/MSIX install reads the same file) and restart Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-parley": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": ["<npm root -g>\\code-parley\\dist\\server\\main.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Write the JSON with an editor (double backslashes); a shell that eats backslashes produces a server
that fails to start (`spawn … ENOENT`). Desktop's server log is
`%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-code-parley.log`.

**Claude Desktop, Code tab.** Code-tab sessions load the same entry; no extra setup. All Code-tab
sessions share one server process.

To remove a manual install: `npm uninstall -g code-parley`. It leaves the data home and
`config.json`.
